        <h1>Welcome to Level 1 of the Treasure Hunt Game!</h1>
        <p>In this level, you will embark on an exciting adventure to find hidden treasure within a 5x5 grid. Each cell in the grid represents a possible location where the treasure might be concealed. Your task is to uncover the treasure by clicking on the cells. Be careful, as not every cell contains the treasure!</p>
        <p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grid Exploration:</strong> The game board consists of 25 cells arranged in a 5x5 grid. Click on any cell to explore it.</li>
            <li><strong>Clues and Feedback:</strong> After each click, you will receive a clue about how close you are to the treasure. These clues will help you narrow down the potential locations of the treasure:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Very close!</strong> You are within 2 cells of the treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Close!</strong> You are within 4 cells of the treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>A bit far!</strong> You are within 6 cells of the treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Far away!</strong> You are more than 6 cells away from the treasure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> Your score will increase with each cell you explore. Try to find the treasure with the fewest clicks to keep your score low.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning the Level:</strong> If you uncover the cell containing the treasure, a congratulatory popup will appear. Click the "Next Level" button in the popup to proceed to Level 2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Your goal is to find the hidden treasure with the fewest possible clicks. Pay attention to the clues to guide your search and improve your chances of success.</p>
        <p>Good luck, treasure hunter! Your adventure begins now. Start exploring the grid and find that treasure!</p>
