            <h1>Welcome to Level 5 of the Treasure Hunt Game!</h1>
            <p>In this level, you will explore a 9x9 grid to find the hidden treasure. Each cell represents a possible location for the treasure. Your task is to uncover the treasure by clicking on the cells. Not every cell contains the treasure, so use the clues wisely!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grid Exploration:</strong> The game board consists of 81 cells arranged in a 9x9 grid. Click on any cell to explore it.</li>
                <li><strong>Clues and Feedback:</strong> After each click, you will receive a clue indicating your proximity to the treasure. Use these clues to narrow down the potential locations:

                </li>
                <li><strong>Score:</strong> Your score increases with each cell you explore. Aim to find the treasure with the fewest clicks to keep your score low.</li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Level:</strong> Find the cell containing the treasure to win the level. A congratulatory popup will appear. Click the "Next Level" button in the popup to proceed to Level 6.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Your goal is to find the hidden treasure with the fewest possible clicks. Pay attention to the clues to guide your search and improve your chances of success.</p>
