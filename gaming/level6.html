        <h1>Welcome to Level 6 of the Treasure Hunt Game!</h1>
        <p>In this level, you will explore a 10x10 grid to find the hidden treasure. Each cell represents a possible location for the treasure. Your task is to uncover the treasure by clicking on the cells. Not every cell contains the treasure, so use the clues wisely!</p>
        <p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grid Exploration:</strong> The game board consists of 100 cells arranged in a 10x10 grid. Click on any cell to explore it.</li>
            <li><strong>Clues and Feedback:</strong> After each click, you will receive a clue indicating your proximity to the treasure. Use these clues to narrow down the potential locations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Move Left!</strong> You are within 1-2 cell of the treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move Right!</strong> You are within 2-3 cells of the treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move Up!</strong> You are within 3-4 cells of the treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move Down!</strong> You are more than 5 cells away from the treasure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> Your score increases with each cell you explore. Aim to find the treasure with the fewest clicks to keep your score low.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning the Level:</strong> Find the cell containing the treasure to win the level. A congratulatory popup will appear with a video. Click the "Next Level" button in the popup to proceed to the next level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Your goal is to find the hidden treasure with the fewest possible clicks. Pay attention to the clues to guide your search and improve your chances of success.</p>
        <p>Good luck, treasure hunter! Start exploring the grid and find that treasure!</p>
